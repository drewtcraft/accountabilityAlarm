# accountabilityAlarm

### Project Summary
An alarm app with a twist. Users are paired based on what time they set an alarm, then must solve a collaborative puzzle in order to shut their alarms off. Constructed a raspberry pi-powered alarm clock that connects via wifi. Real-time collaboration accomplished using websockets; nasty JSON objects stored in a noSQL database; front-end written in react-native.
